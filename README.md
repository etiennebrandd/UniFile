Installing Python and dependencies:
1. Check if Python v3 or higher is installed by running ``python3`` in command prompt
  - If Python not installed, download version 3 from https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Check pip is installed with Python3 by running ``pip3 help`` in command prompt (should return help info)
3. To install Python libraries, run ``pip3 install <library>``  e.g. ``pip3 install flask``
